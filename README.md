If you then click on the "Tab x" text of another tab header, you should get a pop asking if you want to continue.
If you select cancel, then you will remain on in the same tab.
If you click anywhere else on another tabs header, that tab will open with no prompt.

The issue is how do I get the prompt if I click anywhere on a tab header?
